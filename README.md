# hello-world（with self introduction）
# 您好！(附上自我介绍)
This is my first project
I am a designer who is interested in both user-interface design and user experiment design. For me, design is not a wall but a brigde to the path of beautiful, elegant, logical solutions.
Empathy is a word full of great mysterious and enchantment, and also the way I need to seek for my entire life. To understand the world isn't just questioning who we are, but also embrace the world with passion whether it's your stunning moment or failure part.
Also, I know a little bit knowledge about Swift coding ,C++, C#, Java, cause I major software engineering in my undergraduate period.

But my own passion is still focusing on design, and everything around it. So here's my Behance website: https://www.behance.net/mattlynn Hope you like it.
